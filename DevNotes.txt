TODO:

THOUGHT - when i add an input does every component input / external outputs index get shifted
I mean, yes it does but does that affect anything - probably
THIS IS PROBABLY THE PROBLEM IF IT GOES TITS UP
solution would be to NOT store the base index within component and just recalculate every time

Set isbeingplaced to false when finished placing a port


PORT CLASS:

    bool isInputPort
    position
    size

    int corresponding state vector position (just the index for inputs, index +outputbase for outputs)

WHEN ADDING A PORT MAKE SURE TO RESIZE THE VECTORS!!!

REMEMBER TO SET THE SIZE OF PORTS ALSO 
AND THAT THE ORIGIN IS PADDED SIMILAR TO COMPONENT

The ghost port will be at the back of a vector, no seperate ghost component
