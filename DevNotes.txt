TODO:

- Backspace to cancel placing something doesn't work yet 
    AS I HAVE ALREADY ADDED THE STUFF TO THE VECTOR. Need to remove the last element.

- Be careful with else if statements in the handelevents as in some scenarios both !thing and thing are covered meaning code will never run past that
    Should probs fix this

- Dropdown doesn't update after finsh pressed. Need to restart the program each time right now.
    Helps with builder cleanup for the meantime though


MAKE LOGIC WORK:

- In addcomponent, if it is a subcircuit:
    Let the compinfo know about the "metadata" stuff
    Load the subdefinition netlist and fill in the rest of the metadata (numinputs outputs)
    Create a substate and add that to the substates vector

    So each subcircuit compinfo points to a netlist def and has the same index as a circuit state

    If this subcircuit in itself contains subcircuits:

        The json loader needs to resize state stuff itself and do all that too ///


TO DO TOMMOROW 19/09:

    - Fix issues with not seeing wire while drawing, wire snapping not to the output pin etc etc
