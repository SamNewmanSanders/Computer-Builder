TODO:

- Backspace to cancel placing something doesn't work yet 
    AS I HAVE ALREADY ADDED THE STUFF TO THE VECTOR. Need to remove the last element.

- Be careful with else if statements in the handelevents as in some scenarios both !thing and thing are covered meaning code will never run past that
    Should probs fix this

- Dropdown doesn't update after finsh pressed. Need to restart the program each time right now.
    Helps with builder cleanup for the meantime though
