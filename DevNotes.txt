TODO:

- Backspace to cancel placing something doesn't work yet 
    AS I HAVE ALREADY ADDED THE STUFF TO THE VECTOR. Need to remove the last element.

- Be careful with else if statements in the handelevents as in some scenarios both !thing and thing are covered meaning code will never run past that
    Should probs fix this

- Dropdown doesn't update after finsh pressed. Need to restart the program each time right now.
    Helps with builder cleanup for the meantime though



- MAKE HELPER FUNCTIONS THAT DO SIMPLE THINGS LIKE LOADING A JSON FILE SO I DONT HAVE TO KEEP INCLUDING STUFF
- to do this you'll need to become familiar with how the paths work though so do this later

- In the setupCircuitDropdown function in the UI file, it is reading json stuff. Move this to a helper

- Make .cpp files for header functions as it significantly slows down build times




MAKE LOGIC WORK:

- In update loop (for subcircuit):
    Set the first (n = inputValues.size()) values in the subcircuit state vector to match the external input vector
    Maybe resize the input vector like the output and any missing set to false? Would make it idiotproof
    Then simply call update on the subcircuit instance


THE WHOLE INSTANCE THING MAY BE COMPLETELY UNECCESARY!! FOR NOW JUST SET DEF TO NULLPTR IN STATE!!!
