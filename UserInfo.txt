THIS FILE CONTAINS INFO ABOUT COMPONENTS. When inputs / outputs are listed it is according to their index, 
a.k.a the order the pins go DOWN the component.


SRLATCH:
    Inputs [ Reset, Set ]
    Outputs [ Q ]

DLATCH:
    Inputs [ Data, Enable]
    Outputs [ Value ]

DFLIPFLOP
    - Only changes output value on clock rising edge
    Inputs [ Data, Clock]
    Outputs [ Value ]

1 BIT REGISTER
    - Bit more convoluted here.
    - If you just did CLOCK && ENABLE, the flip flop can update at the wrong time if the clock is high and enable does on->off->on
    - Instead connect clock directly. If data && enable, put the data in. If !enable, feed the output back in (don't change).

    Inputs [ Data, Enable, Clock]
    Outputs [ Value ]

4 BIT REGISTER  
    - Just a load of 1 bit registers
    Inputs [ D3, D2, D1, D0, Enable, Clock]
